<strong>A Data-Driven Look at Chicago Neighborhoods:</strong>

I built this interactive site to explore how school quality, crime rates, and income levels shape housing prices across Chicago. Using a combination of public datasets, machine learning models, and geospatial visualizations, the platform uncovers how economic and social factors intersect at the neighborhood level.

It’s a way to surface patterns that often go unnoticed — and to show how data can be used not just to predict value, but to understand it.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to the complexity of the dataset, ZIP code <strong>60608</strong> is recommended for the smoothest user experience and clearest insight into the model’s output.</p>
