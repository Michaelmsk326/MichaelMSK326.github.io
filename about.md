Hi, I’m Michael.

I’ve always been someone who learns by building - whether it’s diving into a dataset, contributing to policy, or taking on roles where the expectations are high and the learning curve is steep. That mindset has shaped my path so far: from supporting fuel operations, to contributing to AI governance, and now studying Finance and Applied Mathematics at Lehigh University.

My interest in finance isn’t just about numbers - it’s about systems, decision-making, and how financial thinking can be used to drive efficiency and long-term value. At LUKOIL, I helped uncover ways to increase profit margins by improving operational workflows. At the NYC Mayor’s Office, I supported the development of AI policy aligned with the UN 2030 Agenda, focusing on transparency, ethics, and financial sustainability. Every role has pushed me to think more critically and act more strategically.

Outside of academics, I tutor students in math and statistics, and I spent over a decade as a competitive swimmer - training under Olympic-level coaches and competing at elite meets. That background instilled in me a sense of discipline, resilience, and quiet confidence I now carry into everything I do.

I’m currently exploring opportunities where I can bring sharp analysis, thoughtful strategy, and real drive - whether in finance, sustainability, or technology.
