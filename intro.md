	<blockquote>
		I don’t just analyze numbers — I analyze what moves them.

	<p>
		Behind every dataset is a system. Behind every system is an incentive. My work lives at that intersection — whether it's mapping how neighborhood conditions shape housing prices, exploring how AI policy aligns with global goals, or finding financial efficiencies others overlook. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I care about clarity, accountability, and long-term value. And I build with those in mind — whether it’s in a model, a dashboard, or a decision.
